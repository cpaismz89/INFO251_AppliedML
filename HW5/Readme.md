# Problem Set 5, due Nov 13 at 11:59pm
- Your mission for this problem set is to use your knowledge of supervised machine learning to try to predict which passengers aboard the Titanic were most likely to survive. The prompts for this part of the problem set are deliberately vague - the goal is to leave it up to you how to structure (most of) your analysis. 

- Over the past months, you have learned the nuts and bolts of a large number of machine learning algorithms. This list includes:

	* Linear Regression
	* Logistic Regression
	* LASSO / Ridge Regression
	* Support Vector Machines
	* Nearest Neighbor
	* k-Nearest Neighbors
	* Naive Bayes
	* Decision Trees
	* Regression Trees
	* Random Forests
	* Boosted trees
	* Perceptrons
	* Neural Networks

	Here, you will explore how well different algorithms can predict survival on the Titanic
