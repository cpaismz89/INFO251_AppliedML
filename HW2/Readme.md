# Problem Set 2, due September 18 at 11:59pm¶
For this assignment, you will be using data from the Progresa program, a government social assistance program in Mexico. This program, as well as the details of its impact, are described in the paper "School subsidies for the poor: evaluating the Mexican Progresa poverty program", by Paul Shultz (available on bCourses). Please familiarize yourself with the PROGRESA program before beginning this problem set, so you have a rough sense of where the data come from and how they were generated. If you just proceed into the problem set without understanding Progresa or the data, it will be very difficult!
